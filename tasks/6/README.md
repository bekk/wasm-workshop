# Task 6 - AssemblyScript - a roundtrip

Your task is to complete the <code>TODO</code>s in <code>index.html</code> to make this code

- Pass a string from js to wasm
- Check that console.log is called from wasm
- Export a global function in js and watch it being called from wasm

## Bonus task

- make <code>nodejs.js</code> do the same wasm code that index.html does
- run it with `node nodejs.js`

(The project in this folder was created by running `npx asinit .`)
