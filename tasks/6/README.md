# Task 6 - Pass string from AssemblyScript to js

Figure out how to build the assemblyscript, so that `build/index.wasm` is built.

Figure out what changes need to be made to `index.html` to make the developer console show "yeah". You will need to use an exported library function to recover the string value of what is returned to javascript.
