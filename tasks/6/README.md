# Task 6 - AssemblyScript - a roundtrip

Run <code>npm run watch</code> to build this task on changes. Refresh <code>index.html</code> to see the results.

Your task is to complete the <code>TODO</code>s in <code>index.html</code> to make this code:

- Pass a string from js to wasm
- Check that console.log is called from wasm
- Export a global function in js and watch it being called from wasm

## Bonus task

- make <code>nodejs.js</code> do the same wasm code that index.html does
- run it with `node nodejs.js`

## Another bonus task

- pass an object by-copy between js and WASM
- pass an object by-reference between WASM and js
