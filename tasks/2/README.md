# Task 2 - Call JavaScript function from WASM

In Task 1 we created a WASM module, exported a function from it, and called it from JavaScript.

In this task we will send a JavaScript function to the WASM module, and have a WASM function call it.

Fix the TODOs in index.html, then build the WASM.

Build WASM:
```sh
npx wat2wasm callback.wat
```
